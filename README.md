ðŸŽµ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸŽµ

I recently completed a Spotify clone project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to dive deep into web development and enhance my skills. Here are some features I implemented:

Responsive Design: The interface adjusts seamlessly across various devices.
Music Playback: Users can play, pause, and navigate through tracks.
Dynamic UI: Interactive elements that mimic the look and feel of Spotify.
Playlist Management: Users can create and manage playlists.
